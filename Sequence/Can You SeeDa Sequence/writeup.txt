This problem requires you to pull out revelevant information from the challenge description

The title indicates a SeeD, this would lead you to believe the sequence has something to do with a pRNG. 


If you asc me, thisss looks pretty random.
pretty crypic, asc indicates ascii
thisss, indicates python
and pretty random  reassures us that random is in fact being used..

import random 

seq = [...]
for i in range(10):
	random.seed(i)
	potential = [random.randint(0,128) for j in range(10)]
	print(potential)
