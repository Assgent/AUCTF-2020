In this problem, the investigator is  told that one of the developers may be stealing information from the company devs-r-us. The user must determine if this is true.

To start with the investigator should go to the devs-r-us website, dev-r-us.xyz.

Examining the source code shows csomething curious about the images. they appear to be the same image but are named two different things 'mcafee.png' and 'mcoffee.png'.

Examining the metadata, the investigators should note a link to a discord channel as well as a message contained within the XMP description field 'https://discord.gg/pMzcE45 DM me if you want more info'.

What the investigator may not know at this point is that this isn't the ONLY piece of embedded information on the website.

Upon clicking the 'contact us' button of the main website, the browser is redirected to another webpage that looks almost identical; however, there is a hidden message on this new webpage with a password 'Who is Maddaddam?'.

Following the discord link, the investigator is lead to the AUCTF server. They must then contact the user JG, or Jorge Greenwood, the web developer for devs-r-us.xyz. They must tell Jorge the password before he directs them to another Discord server that contians a single message embedded in the QR code of an image. The QR code redirects a persons browser to the following link: http://devs-r-us.xyz/ahsdbwgjkhb23tsdonoqw1892345bnew/flag.txt
