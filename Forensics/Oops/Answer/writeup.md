Open vhdx file using 7zip or alternatively you can binwalk and extract the initrd.gz file. 

Extract initrd.gz
```file initrd```

Extract the cpio archive
```cpio -idv < initrd```

```cd /bin/ && cat ./cat```

use the key.txt "soGJvcjTknXM" to solve the VigenÃ¨re cipher


Also the flag is also in initrd, /usr/bin/find left it there by accident :)
