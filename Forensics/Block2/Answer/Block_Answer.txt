First you need to create a database to put the table in. 
CREATE DATABASE temp;

Then take the .sql file and put in the database.
source /path/to/database/file/co_block.sql

Then use the database you created
USE temp;

Finally find all the rows where rolled_back = 1 
SELECT * FROM co_block WHERE rolled_back = 1

Only one row meets those parameters and it has the unix timestamp of: 1581060905
Insert the timestamp into the flag format. 

auctf{1581060905}
