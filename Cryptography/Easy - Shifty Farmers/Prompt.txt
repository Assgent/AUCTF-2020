Alice and Bob noticed something strange about the farmers. Everytime they would Go to the farmer's market, the faintest glimmer of a smile would appear at the Edges of their mouths. Farmers whom they had never met knew Alice and Bob by name when they would approach the stalls. One day, they saw one them writing in a red diary. Unaware of their prying eyes, the farmer made several calculations and quickly scribbled in the book. He looked up and saw them watching him, and quickly shut the book and made way to his Truck. Behind him fell this note.
