This is a RSA problem focusing on small n factorization

if the prime value p and q are too small, this results a factorable n. Because n is factorable the attacker can then calculate the decreyption exponent and decreypt all ciphertext transmitted between the given parties.

1. Factor n to get the folowing primes:
	n = p*q
		n = 627585038806247
		p = 13458281 
		q = 46631887
	
2. calculate phi
	phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
	
3. calculate d such that d*e is congruent with 1 mod phi
	e = 65537
	d = 119987789848673
	
4. decreypt the message:
	c = ciphertext value
	x = plaintext value
	
	c**d mod n = x
	
5. do this for all of the values

6. convert int into ascii



Alternatively, you can calculate the ciphertext values for every valid value within the ascii range, and then compare those values to the ciphertext:
