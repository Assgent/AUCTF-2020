On their way back from the market, Alice and Bob noticed an little device on the ground. Next to it was a piece of paper with what looked like a bunch of scrambled numbers on it. It looked completely random. They took it to the lost and found, but on their way they played with it a little bit, don't tell anyone. The device was never picked up, so we get to play with it. Can you figure out how the device works?
