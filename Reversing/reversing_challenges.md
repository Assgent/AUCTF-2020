# Reversing Challenge Descriptions

## Basic Crackme

Simple crackme program. Prompts users three times for different inputs. The first input is hardcoded in the binary,
the second is hard coded but backwards, and the third is obfuscated with an custom xor encryption.

## Intermediate Keygen

Very basic keygen where it takes in a number performs some arbitrary calculations on it and then
forces it to fit within ASCII character 0x41 - 0x71

## Resource Binary

## Encrypted Binary

## Custom Packing

## Exception Flow Control

## Debug Trap Challenge
