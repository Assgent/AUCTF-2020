# Easy - Encrypted

Challenges binary has been encrypted with an xor cipher.

First step is figuring out how to decrypt it.

Once decrypted you will have to figure out how to login to the command prompt
    `username: bucky`
    `password: longing, rusted, seventeen, daybreak, furnace, nine, benign, homecoming, one, freight car`

Once here you can open flag.txt but you need to recover the password

The password is XOR encrypted with a seed that is pulled from a hardcoded array
    `opensesame`
